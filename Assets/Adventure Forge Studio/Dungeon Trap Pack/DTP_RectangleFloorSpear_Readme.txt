Thank you for purchasing the Dungeon Trap - Rectangle Floor Spear.

In this packed you will find 1 unique medieval inspired trap as well as 2 triggers, a pressure plate and a lever. 
All models have textures ranging from 512px on small objects, up to 2048px on large objects, all are PBR textures, and all have animations, though the models
are set up in a way that you can animate them differently within Unity if you need to. 
Below you’ll find more detailed info about each object and it’s animation timings. All animations have been set up beforhand with triggers and can be viewed in the demo scene
by triggering the animations inside the animator window. This is done by opening up the animator window, selecting the parent node of the trap and hitting the trigger while in play mode.
